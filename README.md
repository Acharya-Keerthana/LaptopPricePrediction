## 📊 Problem Statement

Accurately predict the price of laptops based on specifications such as:

- Brand
- Processor type
- RAM size
- Storage (SSD/HDD)
- Display resolution
- GPU
- Touchscreen availability
- Weight, OS, and more

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **XGBoost**
- **Streamlit**

---

## 🧠 Model Building Steps

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
3. Model Training using:
   - Linear Regression
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - XGBoost Regressor
4. Model Evaluation using metrics like R² and RMSE
5. Streamlit Web App Deployment

## 🚀 How to Run

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### 1. Download or Clone the Repository

You can:

- Click the green **"Code"** button and choose **Download ZIP**, then extract it, or
- Use Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/laptop-price-prediction.git
cd laptop-price-prediction
````

---

### 2. Install Required Libraries

Ensure you have Python installed, then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> If `requirements.txt` is missing, install manually:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn xgboost streamlit
```

---

### 3. Run the Streamlit App

Start the web application using:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Your browser will open a local web interface where you can input laptop specs and get predicted prices.

### 🧠 Learn by Writing, Not Just Copying

> ⚠️ Don't just copy-paste the code — **write it yourself**.
>
> Typing and debugging the code builds deeper understanding of how ML and web apps work. Break the code, fix it, explore it, and experiment — that’s real learning! 💪

---

## ✅ Future Enhancements

* Add support for more features like battery life, screen size, etc.
* Host the app on Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, or AWS
* Add image input (e.g., detect specs from a screenshot)
